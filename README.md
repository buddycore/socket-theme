# socket-theme
WordPress + BuddyPress Combo theme

# About this theme
This theme is partially developed and may need built from scratch to familiarise with the goals of the project which are as follow:

* to create a responsive WordPress + BuddyPress combo theme with support for WooCommerce
* to allow some front-end customisations via the WordPress Customizer API
* to have a solid codebase incorporating the native functionality of the 3 main platforms supported

# SCSS / SASS
The style is compiled with SASS, and whilst modularity has been considered for another designer a different approach may be used. This would require the SCSS files located in asset/scss/* would need replaced for the new users styles.

# Markup / HTML
Markup in the theme has been written with HTML5 elements in mind with a goal of accessibility in mind, sensible tags have been used.

# Progressive enhancements
The only client side scripting used here is via jQuery and a custom plugin I wrote last year called CeNav. This allows for touch menus when clicking on sibling elements with a CSS class of .cenav. 

WooCommerce has JavaScript loaded for some of its cart functionality but this is out the scope of this readme for now.

# Conclusion
I've ceased development for now, I worked on a number of WordPress themes in my spare time. I would like to revisit this, but would be nice to see the project move from another users point of view. Maybe that would be my time to join back in.
